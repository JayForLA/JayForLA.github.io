                        Hi! My name is Jay Anand and I am a first-year Plan II and Business student from Plano, Texas. This past year at UT has shown me the importance of engaging in necessary conversations regarding issues I believe in, but more importantly, the value of listening to perspectives different from my own. As a member of the Liberal Arts Council, I've seen the positive impact that can occur when passionate people come together to make change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe change can be made within the UT community by including organizations and people who have been excluded from policy creation and implementation in the past. I have consulted with multiple student groups and individuals on my platform in order to ensure that my ideas are not only relevant, but doable. I hope to work on these issues as your Liberal Arts Representative!
                    </p>

                    <!-- <ol> -->
                        <h3>1. Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
                            UT can and should make progress when it comes to including the voices of underrepresented students and protecting marginalized groups on campus. I cannot promise to be the solution to the problem, but I can promise to reach out to and amplify the voices of our most vulnerable communities. I want to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Promote the mentorship program currently developing in COLA to connect minority professors with minority students interested in research</li>
                        <li>Continue to host focus groups to encourage conversations and discussion regarding issues affecting marginalized groups on campus</li>
                        <li>“Cookies for Comments”: Table on campus and offer cookies in exchange for direct comments on the atmosphere and climate at UT in regards to inclusion and representation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>2. Fresh Produce on Campus</h3>
                            UT is classified as a food desert, or an area that lacks access to affordable fresh fruits and vegetables. With Kins and Jester Market marking up the prices on produce, only students with transportation and time are able to travel to supermarkets to buy food.<br>
                            This past year, I worked with Sprouts Scouts, an organization dedicated to helping food deserts, and have learned the positive impact of having access to fresh food. I want to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bring more local farm stands to campus to increase access to affordable, fresh produce</li>
                        <li>Expand the UT Farm Stand from a semester occurance to a monthly opportunity</li>
                        <li>Work with the city of Austin and local businesses to provide donations in the form of fresh produce for on campus events</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>3. Addressing Interpersonal Violence</h3>
                            To all survivors, I want you to know that we believe you and want to support you. I plan on making good on that promise by including Voices Against Violence (VAV) in university policy creation regarding interpersonal violence and emphasizing the services VAV offers by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Planning a specific SG fundraising event for the VAV Support campaign in order to fund the Survivors Emergency Fund</li>
                        <li>Working with VAV in advertising the Survivors Emergency Fund to survivors in need</li>
                        <li>Including VAV in redesigning the SURE Walk campaign to include information on bystander intervention and consent in addition to current risk reduction strategies</li>
                    </ul>
